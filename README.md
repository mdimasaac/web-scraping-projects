## 01. Decathlon Latest Sale

will be scraped using beautifulsoup4 and selenium. Following infos will be displayed:
- product name
- product brand
- old price
- discount in %

## 02. Trader Joe Store Addresses

This project shows the very basic runs in web scraping using both beautifulsoup and selenium.<br>
It is a good example to learn the syntaxes, as well as the frequently executed <br>
operations in both methods. The selenium and beatuifulsoup parts are separated <br>
inside the code file, to help understand the difference in each functions. <br>
There is also a part where we get to see how geopy works to get the <br>
latitude and longitude of an address, that we can use in other works <br>
outside of the coding (e.g. mapping each stores in Tableau).<br>
You can see the finished result in the attached csv file.
